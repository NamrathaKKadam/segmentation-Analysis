CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
========================================

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using data analytics and machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, we can identify distinct groups of customers, 
which helps in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and business growth strategies.

📂 DATASET
---------------------
The dataset contains information about customers, including:
- **Demographics**: Income, age, marital status, education level.
- **Purchase History**: Amount spent on different product categories.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Number of purchases via web, catalog, or stores.
- **Promotional Campaigns**: Response to previous marketing campaigns.

📌 Dataset Source: *(https://www.kaggle.com/code/analystoleksandra/marketing-analytics-customer-segmentation)*  
📌 File Format: CSV / Excel  

🔍 STEPS IN THE PROJECT
---------------------
Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Perform descriptive statistics.

Step 2: Data Visualization
- Visualize customer spending patterns using bar charts, histograms, and boxplots.
- Check correlations between features using a heatmap.
- Identify outliers using scatter plots.

Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Create new features like total spending (MntTotal).
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., marital status, education).
- Normalize numerical data for clustering.

Step 4: Customer Segmentation using K-Means
- Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers.
- Visualize the clusters using scatter plots.

Step 5: Insights & Business Recommendations
- Analyze each customer segment.
- Provide marketing strategies based on segmentation results.

📊 TECHNOLOGIES USED
---------------------
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning - K-Means Clustering)

🚀 HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
---------------------
1️⃣ **Load the Dataset:**  
   - Run the first few cells in the Jupyter Notebook to load and explore the data.

2️⃣ **Preprocess the Data:**  
   - Handle missing values, scale the data, and prepare it for clustering.

3️⃣ **Run K-Means Clustering:**  
   - Execute the cells related to the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.

4️⃣ **Visualize and Analyze Results:**  
   - Use scatter plots and heatmaps to understand customer segments.

5️⃣ **Interpret Insights:**  
   - Review the clustering results and suggest marketing strategies.
